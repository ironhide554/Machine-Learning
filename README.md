## Introduction
Machine learning is a rapidly evolving field that has revolutionized numerous industries, from healthcare to finance and beyond. Understanding the inner workings of machine learning algorithms and models is essential for mastering the art of data science and making informed decisions.

In this repository, I embark on a journey to explore various machine learning algorithms and delve into their mathematical and statistical intuition. Through code implementations, and real-world examples, I aim to demystify complex concepts and empower others to embark on their own learning journeys.

## Learning Schedule
Below is the outline of my learning schedule, where I explore different machine learning algorithms and their mathematical/statistical foundations day by day:

### Day 1: Fetching the Data through API

### Day 2: Web Scraping

### Day 3: Data_Understanding

### Day 4: Exploratory Data Analysis(Univariate Analysis)

### Day 5: Exploratory Data Analysis(Bivariate and Multivariate Analysis)

### Day 6: Pandas Profiling(Short Method for Analysis)

### Day 7: Feature Scaling(Standardization)
